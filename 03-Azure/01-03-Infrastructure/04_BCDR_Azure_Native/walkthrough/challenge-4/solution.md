# Walkthrough Challenge 4 - Microsoft Defender for Cloud integration with Azure Arc

Duration: 30 minutes

[Previous Challenge Solution](../challenge-3/solution.md) - **[Home](../../Readme.md)** - [Next Challenge Solution](../challenge-5/solution.md)

## Prerequisites

Please ensure that you successfully passed [challenge 3](../../Readme.md#challenge-3) before continuing with this challenge.

In this challenge you will learn how to protect your on-premise Hyper-V virtual machines with Microsoft Azure Backup Server (MABS). For this MicroHack, we are using Nested Virtualization (Windows server with Hyper-V role) in Azure as an emulation of the on-Premise environment (server Name: cmhost).

Actions:

* Install the Microsoft Azure Backup Server (MABS) in the on-premise infrastructure
* Add a Backup Storage to the MABS disk storage
* Register an on-premise Windows server (Windows server 2016) to the MABS
* Protect the registered VM with MABS
* Register the on-premise Hyper-V host to the MABS
* Protect two Hyper-V's VMs with MABS
* Recover a VM using the recovered vhdx from MABS

### Task 1: Install the Microsoft Azure Backup Server (MABS)

### Download the MABS

As a first step, we will Download the Microsoft Azure Backup Server (MABS) from the Azure Recovery Services Vault that we created in [challenge 1](../../Readme.md#challenge-1). 

To protect on-premises workloads, the MABS server **must be located on-premises**, and **connected to a domain**. You can run the server on a Hyper-V VM, a VMware VM, or a physical host. The recommended minimum requirements for the server hardware are two cores and 8-GB RAM. The supported operating systems are:

* Windows Server 2019 (Standard, Datacenter, Essentials) - 64 bit
* Windows Server 2016 and latest SPs (Standard, Datacenter, Essentials) - 64 bit

We will download and install the MABS in a Windows Server 2016 located in the Hyper-v server (cmhost) and joined to "contosomortgage.local" domain (cmMABS). 

* Form the server 2016 navigate to **Recovery Services Vault** in the West Europe (mh-rsv-weu) which we created in the first Challenge. Under **Backup**, select **On-Premises** and **Hyper-V Virtual Machine** and **Prepare Infrastructure**.

* In the Prepare infrastructure pane that opens, select the **Download links for Install Azure Backup Server** and **Download vault credentials** (You will use the vault credentials during registration of Azure Backup Server to the Recovery Services vault).

* **Download** the Microsoft Azure Backup Server (MABS), select all the files and **Download all the files** coming in from the Microsoft Azure Backup download page, and place all the files in the same folder.



### Task 3: Check that the server is visible in the inventory with all checks green.



Congratulations! You secured any server which is outside of Azure and onboarded via Azure Arc.
